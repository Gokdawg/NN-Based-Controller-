# NN-Based-Controller-
This controller is based on a paper written by Prof B.K Mukherjee, K. Goel and M. Sinha.
While the paper deals with 'Sliding Mode Control', this controller is being designed to carry out time delayed control.
We are in the process of integrating this controller with a simulator / toolbox to verify its functioning
